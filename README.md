# Bow Card Website
This is the code for the Bow Cards website, a class project.
This was for the Sales Project in Creativity.

## Information
This is a project by Blast Off Waters.

## Setup
To use this site's code, rename the dbconfig.json.example file to dbconfig.json. This uses a PostgreSQL database. You need to input a database connection URL into that file to connect to the database.
There is only one table, called general_data.
The table needs 3 columns, the first called code (TEXT), second called type (TEXT), and a third one called animation_id (INT).
